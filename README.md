Paint Application - OpenGL/C/C++

The intention is to create a version of the well-known drawing application "Paint", which
should be implemented in C / C ++ using OpenGL.
This exercise counts 20% for the grade of practical work.
You should implement a version of the application taking into account the following
points:
· The interaction is at the discretion of the student, but it must be possible to use the mouse and the
keyboard.
· The application window should have at least 2 areas: a work area (where
made the graphic forms); and one of tools (where you must have a
colors and a toolbar).
· It must be possible to insert several graphical forms. Consider at least the
lines, triangles, squares, rectangles, polygons, and circles.
· It should be possible to define background and contour colors for each of the
graphic forms.
· It should be possible to delete and move graphic shapes.
· It should be possible to change the size of the window.
· The program should give feedback on what is happening (eg how
color selected, or what mode you are working in).
